The purpose of this repository is to store all class notebooks and data from Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course. 

At SNR we are currently working towards building a Machine Learning algorithm for a DNA genetics based company. Therefor, I will be taking this course to boost my understanding of the basic machine learning topics and standards of the community.
